# *Difference Calculator*
### This application reveals the difference between 2 `json` and `yaml` files.
### To call the "help" command, use `./build/install/app/bin/app -h`

### In this application, 3 formatters are implemented, for output to the terminal, the name of these formatters is `stylish`, which is installed by default. There is also a `plain` formatter
### and `json` formatter. Use the `-f` flag to use the formatter.

### For example, `./build/install/app/bin/app -f json filepath1.json filepath2.json`, this formatter will output the difference in json file format.
